# hello-world
My first repository 
This is a test to add some info in this file prior to my first commit
I'm doing this to become more familiar with Git
Let's add a few other lines to this
Just to see what a 2nd commit looks like!
Adress is in Suresnes

Now we're couple of month later, I'm adding those lines.
Still works when I commit?
